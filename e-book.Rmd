```


Chipers in separate shiny app :D
```{r, echo = FALSE}
shinyAppDir("button/",
  options = list(width = "100%", height = 150)
)
```


Chipers in javascript shiny app :D
```{r, echo = FALSE}
shinyAppDir("buttonJS/",
  options = list(width = "100%", height = 700)
)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
